In this study, two user experiments followed by statistical
analyses to get an in-depth understanding of image similarity for HDR
images. First, a large number of human similarity responses via crowdsourcing is collected, and then several image features with respect to the collected data is evaluated. Evaluation is performed both on individual features and on their combination. When combining features, two models both of which using logistic regression are considered. Although both models are found to perform comparably, the second one permits direct one-to-one comparison, making it more suitable for practical applications. One such application, namely style-based tone mapping that benefits from the
experimental findings is given. Key observations obtained in our work are the following:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item When properly tone mapped images are used as compared to using either original or linearly scaled HDR images, higher correlations with human responses are obtained.
\item Most tone mapping operators (TMOs) yield comparable performance.
\item Deeply learned features, in comparison to hand-crafted features, correlate better with the human responses.
\item Among hand-crafted features, GIST yields the highest correlation, followed by color, luminance, and texture.
\item Combination of features performs better than individual features.
\item All of the estimated correlations for the second experiment are higher in comparison to those for the first experiment.
\end{enumerate}

The first observation highlights the importance of using tone mapped data
for HDR image similarity. While tone mapping is a lossy process, it
brings the data to a more meaningful range for the computation of most
features. However, some features are less dependent on tone mapping. For
instance the texture feature represented by the histogram of oriented
gradients is found to produce about the same correlation regardless of
whether HDR or tone mapped data is used. This is followed by the color
feature represented by 2D chromaticity histogram. Among the hand-crafted
features the largest difference is  observed for luminance feature
when tone mapped data is used for representation. This can be expected as
non-linear luminance compression often eliminates large gaps in
luminance histogram where little useful information is present.

Perhaps unexpectedly, the second observation suggests that TMOs perform comparably. Although there exists a large number of TMO evaluation studies, we are not aware of any work that compares TMOs for the task of HDR image similarity. The lowest performing operator is found to be Pattanaik et
al.'s~\cite{pattanaik2000time} algorithm. It is, however, known that
this algorithm highly depends on calibrated input data and viewing
conditions as it tries to accurately model the human visual system.

As for the third observation, it is not surprising to find that 
features obtained from a DCNN~\cite{simonyan2014very} trained over a large image dataset~\cite{russakovsky2015imagenet} outperform simple hand-crafted
features. Similar findings are reported by image retrieval studies
conducted for low dynamic images~\cite{wan2014deep,gordo2016deep}. For
HDR images, our findings indicate that deep features are mostly useful if the images are tone mapped to the 8-bit per color channel domain
first. This is also expected as the training data of DCNNs are comprised of such images.

The fourth observation indicates that the GIST descriptor surpasses the other hand-crafted features, texture, luminance, and color for HDR image similarity. In addition to outperforming them, in fact, it performs surprisingly consistently across different processing types. Despite having a smaller correlation with the user responses than the deep features, it exhibits less variability overall. This may be a desirable property for different applications as it appears to be minimally affected by how an HDR image is processed.

As expected, the fifth observation points to the findings that a combined feature with the learned weights performs better than individual features, which holds true for both of the logistic regression models. Although deeply learned features outperform the hand crafted features, and that is also observed with higher weights in the models, other features also contribute to the performance of the models. 

Pertaining to our last observation, it can be argued that seeking multiple
consistent responses by the participants are important; not only for
developing a more reliable model but also for assessing the correlation
of different features with user responses. For instance, inspection of
Tables~\ref{tab:ind_correlation_p1} and~\ref{tab:ind_correlation_p2} reveals that while deep features correlate better with the user responses, this difference is clearly magnified for the second phase of the experiment. In other words, as the experimental findings become more reliable the merits and drawbacks of different features becomes more noticeable.
